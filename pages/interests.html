                    purchasing his camera in October 2022, he took a weekend trip to Lake Tahoe with friends. It was on
                    this trip that his love for photography blossomed. Since then, Jerrod has traveled back to Lake
                    Tahoe and also places like Yosemite National Park and Disneyland to photograph their unique terrains
                    and landscapes. Photography has become a passion of Jerrod’s and is now one of his favorite hobbies.
