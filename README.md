Peer review comments: Unique background has 3 pages has style follows lms guidlines matches figma almost perfectly
i like the nav bar how it follows you when you scroll a cool icon in the corner the tet getting darker when you click is a nice touch the only thing i would change would the cards being a little to big on interests
